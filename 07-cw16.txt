SpaceX is an American aerospace manufacturer, 
space transportation services and communications 
corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, 
California. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk 
with the goal of reducing space 
transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. 
SpaceX the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, 
several rocket engines, Dragon cargo, 
crew spacecraft and Starlink communications satellites.
SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant 
rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first private company to 
successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), 
the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International 
Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the first vertical take-off and vertical 
propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse 
of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to send 
astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station. 
SpaceX has flown and reflown the Falcon 9 series of rockets over one hundred times.
SpaceX is developing a satellite mega constellation named Starlink 
to provide commercial internet service. 
In January 2020 the Starlink constellation became 
the largest satellite constellation ever launched. 
SpaceX is also developing Starship, a privately funded, 
fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system 
for interplanetary spaceflight. Starship is intended to become the primary 
SpaceX orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, 
Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. 
Starship is planned to be fully reusable and 
will have the highest payload capacity of 
any orbital rocket ever on its debut, 
scheduled for the early 2020s.
